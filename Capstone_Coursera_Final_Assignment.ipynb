Experiments with other groups will indeed help find the best approach.</p>\n",

        "<p>This approach may be of interest for a number of reasons. On the one side we may discover that somehow a group of features correlates with a completely different other group of features if  final city clusters overlap. On the other side we may use this approach for feature selection to use later with supervised machine learning.</p>\n",

For example, if we identify typical features within some clusters, business opportunities may become obvious in cities with strong outliers as compared with other cities of the same cluster. </p>\n",
